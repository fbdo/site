# Don't forget the belonging clues

A reminder to myself, from the book [Culture Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code), a book I can recommend:

- Posture and expressions are important
- Avoid interruptions
- Spotlight your weakness (I can be wrong here)
- Embrace the message (hug the messager)
- Preview future connections
- Overdue thank yous
- Design a painstakingly interview
- Eliminate bad apples (no dickhead policy)
- Design spaces that maximaze collisions
- Everyone has a voice
- Pick up trash
- Capitalize in threshold moments (day one)
- Avoid to give sandwich feedback
- Embrace fun
